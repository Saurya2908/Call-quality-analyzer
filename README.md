# üìû Call Quality Analyzer

This project is an assignment for a **Voice AI developer role**.  
It analyzes a sales call recording and returns:

- **Talk-time ratio** (what % each person spoke)  
- **Number of questions asked**  
- **Longest monologue duration**  
- **Call sentiment** (positive / negative / neutral)  
- **One actionable insight**  

**Bonus**: heuristically identifies the **Sales Rep** vs **Customer**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach (Quick Summary)

- **Audio Processing**: Download via `yt-dlp`, convert to 16kHz mono.  
- **Transcription**: `faster-whisper (tiny)` for speed + noise tolerance.  
- **Speaker Diarization**: MFCC features + `KMeans (k=2)` clustering (fast, lightweight).  
- **Metrics**:  
  - Talk-time ratio = speaker segment durations  
  - Questions = punctuation + WH-word heuristics  
  - Longest monologue = max contiguous segment  
  - Sentiment = NLTK VADER  
- **Actionable Insight**: simple rule-based suggestions (balance, questions, sentiment).  
- **Bonus**: Identify **Sales Rep** by scoring based on talk-time, questions asked, and sales-related keywords.
