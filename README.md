We optimize for speed and robustness. Audio is fetched via yt-dlp, converted to 16 kHz mono, and transcribed with faster-whisper (tiny) using VAD filtering and beam_size=1 for fast, noise-tolerant results on Colab Free. For diarization we avoid heavy models: we slide 1.5 s windows, compute MFCC mean/variance features, and run KMeans (k=2); contiguous windows with the same label are merged into speaker turns. We align word midpoints to turns, then compute: (1) talk-time ratio by summing segment durations, (2) question count via punctuation and WH-sentence heuristics, (3) longest monologue from merged turns, (4) sentiment with NLTK VADER, and (5) a rule-based actionable insight driven by imbalance, question volume, and sentiment. For the bonus, we heuristically tag Sales Rep vs Customer using a weighted score: questions asked, presence of sales keywords, and talk-time share. The code is compact, commented, and avoids paid APIs so it runs reliably on the free tier.
